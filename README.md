## 🔒 Online Use? Read This First

Some mod menus offer bypasses for multiplayer, but **online cheating in Halo Infinite carries major risk**. Use only on alt accounts or offline mode unless you're ready for the consequences.

> 🛡️ Pro tip: Look for menus with stealth injection and spoofing if you’re going ranked mode. Otherwise, campaign chaos is where this tool really shines.
